Usage: java -jar xquest2ProxlXML.jar -o output_filename -l linker_name -r /path/to/xquest_results \
                                   [ -n search_name ] [ --decoy-prefix=decoy ] 

Examples:

	To convert a XQuest search 
	java -jar xquest2ProxlXML.jar -o search.proxl.xml -l dss -r xquest_results_dir

	-o (--output-file=) : [Required] : The absolute or relative path to the ProXL XML file to be created.

	-r  (--results-path=) : [Required] : Full or relative path to the XQuest results directory. 
         
	-l (--linker=) : [Required] : The name of the crosslinker used in the experiment. Must be a string
	                              recognized by ProXL, so that linkable positions in proteins may be
								  displayed. Currently-supported linkers include: dss, bs3, bs2, edc
								  
	-n (--name=) : [Optional] : The name displayed for this search in ProXL after uploading (can be changed in

								contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotes.
								
	--decoy-prefix= : [Optional] : The prefix to use to identify decoy matches based on protein names. If not
								   set, the value for "decoy_filter" in the XQuest configuration file will be used.
		
		
	--fdr-cutoff-on-import= : [Optional] : Specifies the value for the 'FDR' that will be used for the cutoff

										A default of 0.05 is used if a value is not specified. 

	--skip-default-fdr-cutoff-on-import : [Optional] : Specifies that the default value for the 'FDR' 
										will NOT be used for the cutoff for which data will be
										included during the import to Proxl.    


	--rank-cutoff-on-import= : [Optional] : Specifies the value for the 'rank' that will be used for the cutoff 
										for which data will be included during the import to Proxl.  
										A default of one (1) is used if a value is not specified.
