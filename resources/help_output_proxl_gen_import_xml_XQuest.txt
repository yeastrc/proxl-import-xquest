Usage: java -jar xquest2ProxlXML.jar -o output_filename -l linker_name -r /path/to/xquest_results \
                                   [ -n search_name ] [ --decoy-prefix=decoy ] 

Examples:

	To convert a XQuest search 
	java -jar xquest2ProxlXML.jar -o search.proxl.xml -l dss -r xquest_results_dir

	
Parameters:

	-o (--output-file=) : [Required] : The absolute or relative path to the ProXL XML file to be created.

	-r  (--results-path=) : [Required] : Full or relative path to the XQuest results directory. 
         
	-l (--linker=) : [Required] : The name of the crosslinker used in the experiment. Must be a string
	                              recognized by ProXL, so that linkable positions in proteins may be
								  displayed. Currently-supported linkers include: dss, bs3, bs2, edc
								  
								  -l can be repeated multiple times if multiple linkers were used.
								  Note: Proxl associated linker masses with specific linkers in the experiment,
								  but the Kojak parameters file does not currently support this. If multiple
								  linkers are used, a comment must be added after the linker mass in the Kojak
								  conf file, such as the following. The names of the linkers must match those
								  passed in using the -l parameter.
								  
								  cross_link	=	1	1	18.00123	# linker:edc
								  cross_link	=	1	1	138.0680742	# linker:dss
								  mono_link	=	1	155.0946	# linker:dss
			  
	-n (--name=) : [Optional] : The name displayed for this search in ProXL after uploading (can be changed in
								ProXL). If not set, a default name ("Search: <search id>") is used. If the name
								contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotes.
								
	--decoy-prefix= : [Optional] : The prefix to use to identify decoy matches based on protein names. If not
								   set, the value for "decoy_filter" in the Kojak configuration file will be used.
